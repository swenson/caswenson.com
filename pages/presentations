<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/caswenson/learning-java-1-introduction">Learning Java 1 &ndash; Ingtrodcution (2006).</a>
At The University of Tulsa, we often had many incoming students into our

So, I created a small series of presentations to give them a quick overview
of some of the finer points, especially as they would relate to some of the
required course work in the graduate program.
