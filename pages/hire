<h2>Have Code, Will Travel</h2>

<p>Hi, I’m Christopher Swenson. I thought I would try an experiment where I posted a bit about myself and solicited job recommendations or contracting for what I work on next.</p>

<p>I’ve recently left my full-time position as a technology fellow at Capital One, and I am looking for new work, either full-time or part-time as a contractor.</p>

<p>Here is a little about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software developer for 10 years or so — Google, Capital One, Simple, US government, startups, and freelance.</li>
<li>Usually backend development, sometimes devops, frontend, mobile, and embedded.</li>
<li>Also spent years as a researcher and mathematician: I have a Ph.D in computer science, and worked in high-performance computing (HPC), security, and cryptography.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to see a sample of some of my work, you can here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/swenson/sort">sort.h</a>: a somewhat popular high-performance C sorting library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pybee/batavia">BeeWare Batavia</a>: a reference implementation of Python in JavaScript for the <a href="http://pybee.org/">BeeWare</a> project.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047013593X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mathfigu-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=047013593X">Modern Cryptanalysis</a>, a book I wrote in 2008</li>
<li><a href="http://swenson.io/speaking.html">Some talks</a> I have given can be seen on my site.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m happy to send a detailed résumé and discuss more, and you can view a <a href="http://m.caswenson.com.s3.amazonaws.com/resume-mini.pdf">smaller version of my résumé here</a>.</p>

<p>As far as what I am looking for in a company, these are a must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of development work. I like to write code. I am happy to talk to people and manage a team, but I’m only happy if I am coding at least 70% of the time.</li>
<li>Work–Life balance. I don’t want to work myself to death in the next few years.</li>
<li>Remote-friendly or based in Portland, OR. I’m based in Portland, OR, and I have no intention of moving. I love it here. I’ve successfully worked remotely for a number of companies over several years, and I have a formula that works well for me (for instance, I rent my own office outside my home), but it only works of the company I’m working with understands this.</li>
<li>Working with a diverse set of people. Software is people, and homogeneous teams build bland products.</li>
<li>Open source work is welcomed: I love working with the open source community.
Conferences and speaking are supported: I like going to conferences, running conferences, and speaking at conferences.</li>
<li>Good health benefits.</li>
<li>I am happy to travel a fairly arbitrary amount of the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some nice-to-haves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opportunities for research and publishing.</li>
<li>Flexible hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this sounds like you, please contact me at <a href="mailto:swenson@swenson.io">swenson@swenson.io</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
