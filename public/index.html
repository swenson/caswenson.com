<p>I've spent the past 19 months working as a software engineer at Google. They have adopted a lot of great practices, some completely their own, and I certainly learned a lot from working them. I thought I would share some of the particular insights I had while working there.</p>

<p>This first post will be about software engineering. Shortly, I'll post another about general workplace stuff.</p>

<p>First, an overall thought: Google was definitely the most professional place I've worked in terms of software engineering. However, just like any software engineering methodologies, their software engineering Kool-Aid is good, but you don't want to drink all of it.</p>

<h2>Code reviews are a must.</h2>

<p>Prior to Google, I had done very little formal code review as most projects we were simply "too busy" to "take time out" to do them. They are not even a little bit optional at Google: every change to the codebase must undergo at least one person's review, and possibly many more depending on the exact nature of the change and the person making it. At first, I was very skeptical about this, but I learned that there is so much much value in having this formal process, for a multitude of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>First, if you have a small team, code reviews are a good way to keep up with what other people on your project are doing, both on a personal level ("Jane is working on feature X"), as well as understanding what the code does. This means that it will be easier for you to make a modification to the codebase, if it is necessary, or even to take ownership of it should something happen (i.e., team member moves on).</li>
<li>Code reviews don't take as long as you think.</li>
<li>Code reviews significantly increase the quality of the code produced, both in readability, but in catching bugs and poor design decisions. Perhaps not as much as true pair programming, but with a lot fewer of the disadvantages.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, code reviews have one downside: it is often tricky to work on two different reviews on the same part of the codebase at the same time. This depends heavily on your version control system &mdash; distributed version control systems, like git, tend to support this pretty well. But even so, there is some cost in terms of "mental swap space", as sometimes it is difficult to focus on an entirely different change until you hear back on your pending change. The best way to avoid this is make sure your team prioritizes reviewing code above pretty much all else, so that your other team members aren't waiting on you. (Code reviews are a bit like a turn-based game, and when it is the other person's turn, it can seem like it takes forever.) I always tried to have a spare project to work on that I could hack on a little while waiting.</li>
</ol>

<h2>IDEs are worth it for large projects.</h2>

<p>Prior to Google, I despised IDEs. I still don't have a lot of love for them, but reusing Google's extensive codebase in my own code finally broke me out of my IDE-less existence: there is simply <em>too much</em> code to try to wrangle without features like autoimport, name completion, refactoring, etc. I chose Eclipse, because I was doing Java work and Eclipse is well-supported inside Google. As slow as Eclipse is, it saved me a lot of time hunting through docs looking for the right class, with the right class name, the right function name method, etc.: I could just tab-complete my way to freedom a lot of the time.</p>

<h2>Build systems still suck.</h2>

<p>Google has their own build system that integrates with, well, everything. But it still sucks. Not as much as autotools, SCons, Makefiles, but it still sucks. Where, oh where, is the build system of my dreams?
Python and other untyped languages make life harder for large projects.</p>

<p>For small projects or stuff that I am doing by myself, I love Python. The time it saves me is tremendous. However, nothing is more frustrating than programming with a large, unknown codebase in Python. I would often see code like this, even in a well-manicured codebase:</p>

<pre>
def ReadFromDatabase(self, query, metadata):
  """Perform the query on the database."""
  ...
</pre>

<p>So... what is query? A string? What is its format? Could it be a tuple, a list? What is metadata? Essentially, the only answers to these questions were to go digging through documentation, look for other code that calls that function, read through the function itself. And sometimes I just don't have time to go on a coding adventure: I want to call the method and go on with my day. Java, for all of its faults, at least tells you the type information of the parameters, so I have a strong hint for my adventure. This might involve navigating factories, factoryfactories, and all other kinds of abominations, but at least I would have a good start.</p>

<h2>It Should Be Easy To Run Your Program.</h2>

<p>Google programmers love command-line flags. They sprinkle them everywhere. The problem is: they often specify the default values elsewhere, perhaps in a script that only runs in production. It can make running a program locally difficult, which in turns makes testing and debugging hard. The moral I learned is that it should be dead simple to build, run, and test your program. Hunting around for documentation on the perfect incantation magic is a real bummer.</p>

<h2>Test <em>ALL</em> the things.</h2>

<p>Before Google, I hadn't really practiced a lot of TDD. Sure, when I had a small piece of code that had very well-defined inputs and outputs, and if I had time, I would create some doctests (in Python) or the equivalent elsewise, but it was never a priority. At Google, good testing is the state religion. If it doesn't have tests, it doesn't exist. No excuses. I don't care how complex the code is: it has to be tested. Writing the tests firsts often helps, but doesn't always make sense.</p>

<p>I got tired of the old site having issues, so I rewrote the site using a
custom static site generator.</p>

<p>Things pretty much work. I am in the process of moving old Disqus comments over
to the new system, and working with a small issue or two there.</p>

<p>I should have some new material up soon as well!</p>

<p>This is the first post of the year. That's a little sad, but I think I am going to be redoing this site a bit in the near future.</p>

<p>So, some upcoming changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Errata for my book -- this link has been on the RHS of my page for quite a while now, and I haven't gotten around to compiling this errata.  I will do so in the next few days.</p></li>
<li><p>Notes on upcoming projects. I am currently working on several projects, open source and not, and a few writing projects. Expect more details on these.</p></li>

</div><div class="post"><div class="date"><b>dec</b> 01 2010</div><h1><a href="2010_12_01_monospaced_font">Monospaced font</a></h1>
<p>I have been searching for years for a decent programming font (that is, monospaced). Over the years, I've found various ones that suited me, but recently I found ranks as my favorite: <a href="http://www.cosmix.org/software/">Droid Sans Mono, Dotted</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://m.caswenson.com/images/droidsansmono.png" width="901" height="649" alt="Droid Sans Mono Dotted picture" /></p>

<p>Essentially, cosmix created a dotted and slashed zero variant to Droid Sans Mono, part of the <a href="http://www.droidfonts.com/">Droid family of fonts</a> designed for Google's Android operating system.</p>

<p>They are designed to very legible, and I have found the Sans Mono to be clean and pleasant when in the terminal or in a coding window.  It also has pretty decent Unicode support.</p>

<p>My previous favorite coding fonts have been: Monaco, DejaVu Sans Mono, Consolas, and Lucida Sans Console.</p>
</div><div class="post"><div class="date"><b>oct</b> 30 2010</div><h1><a href="2010_10_30_sorting_out_sorting">Sorting out sorting</a></h1>
<p>I <a href="http://github.com/swenson/sort">recently wrote</a> a C version of a bunch of comparison-based sorting algorithms, notably timsort and quicksort.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">Timsort</a> is a neat, unbalanced mergesort that I've been wanting to try out for the past while, and so I spent the time to write a fast C implementation of the algorithm.  My experiments on random data show about a 5-10% improvement over quicksort, which is pretty amazing.  If the data has any structure, which is extremely common, it has "superhuman" performance, as it can merge natural runs in the data in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>Another annoying thing I've noticed is that I've written the same sorting algorithms a ton of times, often just changing the type.  Sometimes I've used the standard C <a href="http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/stdlib/qsort.c?v=GLIBC27">qsort</a>, but the function-pointer comparison function causes awful performance (the version I wrote isn't even as optimized, and is still often twice as fast).  Why can't I just write a good, fast sorting algorithm?</p>

<p>A solution comes from a neat trick in C: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor#Token_concatenation">token pasting</a>.  Using this, it's possible to write the function once, and just swap out the types as needed.</p>

<p>Using token pasting, it is also possible to implement the entire library as a single header file: no library to compile!</p>

<p>Sadly, sorting doesn't usually have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvTW7341kpA">sound effects</a>.</p>
</div><div class="post"><div class="date"><b>jul</b> 18 2010</div><h1><a href="2010_07_18_wordpress_thesis_and_the_gpl">Wordpress, Thesis, and the GPL</a></h1>
<p>There's been <a href="http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/">some hubbub</a> going around the web about Wordpress potentially suing a developer for breaching the GPL.</p>

<p>The quick run-down: Wordpress is licensed under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL2</a>. Thesis is a premium Wordpress theme.</p>

<p>The debate really boils down to: does the GPL require Thesis to be also licensed under the GPL?</p>

<p>The answer: <strong>almost</strong> not, but maybe.</p>

<p>I'll save you some reading.  Clause 2 of GPL2:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate work. &hellip;
</blockquote>

<p>IANAL, but this says, quite clearly, if it is not derived from GPL code <strong>and</strong> can be reasonably considered independent, then the GPL does not apply.</p>

<p>The question is, what does "independent" mean in this sentence.  Does it mean independent in the sense that it can run without it?  Or does it mean the code does not have any code in common with the GPL code?</p>

<p>It's unclear.  I am inclined to the second viewpoint, because the first has a lot of nasty ramifications.  However, some people, including <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLPluginsInNF">the FSF</a>, appear to believe in the first viewpoint (roughly speaking).</p>

<p>Ugh.  Software licensing sucks.  This is why I use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a>.  Mostly because I like putting some kind of license on the code, and this seems one of the least restrictive ones.</p>
</div><div class="post"><div class="date"><b>jun</b> 07 2010</div><h1><a href="2010_06_07_intel_threading_challenge_2010_icfp_2010">Intel Threading Challenge 2010, ICFP 2010</a></h1>
<p>I'm a sucker for programming contests, and have been since high school.</p>

<p>I thought I would post here about one ongoing contest and one upcoming one.</p>

<p>First, the <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/contests/threading-challenge-prof-2010/codecontest.php">Intel Threading Challenge</a> has already started.  Essentially, it a little programming contest that is supposed to test your ability to program effectively for a large multi-threaded task.  The "Master" section this year is writing a program to compute a simple and laborious graph theoretic property.</p>

<p>Second, the annual <a href="http://icfpcontest.org/">ICFP programming contest</a> is right around the corner.  Although nominally a functional programming contest, anyone can enter in any language.  It's an super-fun, intense 72-hour competition.  If you want to try to place, I recommend having a group of about 2&ndash;4 strong programmers.  I won't be able to compete this year because of a scheduling conflict. :(</p>
</div><div class="post"><div class="date"><b>may</b> 20 2010</div><h1><a href="2010_05_20_sliderepl_for_sage">sliderepl for Sage</a></h1>
<p><a href="http://discorporate.us/projects/sliderepl/">sliderepl</a> is a really neat Python presentation tool for demonstrating code, live, in a slide-like format.  Essentially, you organize your code into "slides", which you can then scroll through (though you can't go back, really).  The tool was written originally by <a href="http://discorporate.us/jek/">Jason Kirtland</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to see if I could use it for <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a> code as sort of a GUI-less notebook thing.  Kind of.  Unfortunately, sliderepl is full of hacky magic, involving embedding an interpreter and introspection.  Sage is too, and so they don't like each other very much.</p>

<p>Through some more magic, I figured out how to get them to work together anyway, and released the code on Github as <a href="http://github.com/swenson/sage_sliderepl">sage_sliderepl</a>.</p>
