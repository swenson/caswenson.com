<p>I have been a pretty big fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS">Verizon FiOS</a> ever since I got it last August.  The Internet has not ever gone down that I can recall, TV quality is excellent, and it's competitvely priced.</p>

<p>However, there are a few things that you probably don't know about FiOS, as I didn't until I spent a couple of hours of my evening playing around and on the phone with tech support.</p>

<p><strong>That Ethernet port on your FiOS box? It doesn't work.</strong> Your ONT (the boxy thing that provides the FiOS magic) has a multitude of ports: incoming fiber, and outgoing coax, two phone ports, and an Ethernet port.  It is not possible to use both the coax and the Ethernet port at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>FiOS TV gets its listing and on-demand setting from the Internet.</strong> This has some interesting implications.  I am really curious how this works if you have FiOS TV, but not the Internet plan?</p>

<p><strong>FiOS TV requires the coax port.</strong>  Well, duh, right?.  But, when combined with the previous notes, that means that, <strong>if you have FiOS TV service, you cannot use the Ethernet port</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>FiOS uses bandwidth on that coax cable from 1 to 1150 MHz.</strong>  According to my router, it uses somee range under 1000 MHz for Internet service, and 1001 through 1150 MHz for communicating with FiOS TV.  Note that a lot of cable splitters only go through 900 MHz, so be careful if you start using your own.</p>

<p>Only about half of the tech support guys were helpful when I called (one did not know several of these points when trying to diagnose what my problem was), so watch out if you need to call.</p>
