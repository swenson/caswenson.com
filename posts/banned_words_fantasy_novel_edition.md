Banned Words: Fantasy Novel Edition
===================================
There are certain words that are just used too often in fantasy book titles.  (The same goes for other genres, but that is another post.)

I have constructed the following list of banned words in the titles of books.  Not that I won't read books with these words in their titles, necessarily, or that there are no good books that use these words, it's just that I am sick of seeing books called "The Dragon Wizard Tales" or "Legend of the Elf Knight".  The words are just overused, and they immediately put me off.

The banned words are, in no particular order:

wizard
ring
lord
elf
time
dragon
winter
crown
king
magic
magician
wand
sword
fire
spell
demon
dune
tale
legend
wyrm
fate
knight
ship
bard
god
gods
tower
