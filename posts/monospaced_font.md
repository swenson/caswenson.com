Monospaced font
===============
I have been searching for years for a decent programming font (that is, monospaced). Over the years, I've found various ones that suited me, but recently I found ranks as my favorite: <a href="http://www.cosmix.org/software/">Droid Sans Mono, Dotted</a>.

Essentially, cosmix created a dotted and slashed zero variant to Droid Sans Mono, part of the <a href="http://www.droidfonts.com/">Droid family of fonts</a> designed for Google's Android operating system.

They are designed to very legible, and I have found the Sans Mono to be clean and pleasant when in the terminal or in a coding window.  It also has pretty decent Unicode support.

My previous favorite coding fonts have been: Monaco, DejaVu Sans Mono, Consolas, and Lucida Sans Console.
