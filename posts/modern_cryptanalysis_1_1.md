# Modern Cryptanalysis v1.1 Available for Free

In 2008, I wrote and published a book called *Modern Cryptanalysis*, a technical book
on cryptography and code breaking.

It's been about 14 years since Modern Cryptanalysis was published.
It's had a good run, but it's been out of print for a while now.

As such, I'm releasing it for free!

I've made some very small changes to clean up known errata and to reformat it for US Letter paper, but otherwise I've left it essentially as the 2008 version.

Enjoy! Download here: [Modern Cryptanalysis v1.1](/Modern Cryptanalysis v1.1 2022-01-23.pdf).
