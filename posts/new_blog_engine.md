New blog engine
===============
I successfully moved this site from a Wordpress blog to <a href="http://github.com/adamwiggins/scanty/">scanty</a>, with some <a href="http://github.com/swenson/scanty/">modifications</a>.

I think I have it nearly all working except my old comments.  Rest assured that I have them all (and they are all stored in Disqus), but I haven't gotten them all linked properly.

Let me know if anything is too broken.
