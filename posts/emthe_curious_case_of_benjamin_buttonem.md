<em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>
============================================
I intend to go see <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em> this weekend.  While quickly looking it up on the Internet, I realized that the original short story was published in 1921, and would therefore have fallen out of copyright.

So, I decided to read it.  I found it on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6695">Project Gutenberg</a>, but the copy is (of course) in plain, vanilla ASCII, and has several typos.

I decided then to quickly typeset it so that I would feel more better when reading it.

Feel free to download it <a href="http://www.caswenson.com/pub/button.pdf">here</a>.

I typeset it with Adobe InDesign in Adobe Garamond Pro 12pt.  It's about 11 pages and change long, double-column format.

I fixed some of the Gutenberg-isms (like using "_whatever_" to indicate italics), and corrected what I could as far as typos.  There's one case where the word "array" is used, and I can't find an original source to tell me if that is a mis-OCR for "army" (which would make more sense today, but array could be correct, if a bit arcane).

I liked the short story, but I feel that the movie will give a sense of time passing that the short story rather lacks.
