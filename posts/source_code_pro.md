# Adobe Source Code Pro

Just thought I would mention, since I haven't talked about fonts for a while,
that I would give a short update.

About a year ago, I decided to try
<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html">Adobe Source Code Pro</a>,
a new fixed-width font.

Since I kind of forgot that I was using it, and the experiment has gone on a year,
I'll consider it a success.

I definitely notice that Source Code Pro is better suited to the desktop and
laptop world: the font has a bit higher heights and feels a little more natural
at lower dpi, larger screens (compared to Droid Sans Mono).

It's free. Give it a shot.

P.S.  Also, the web site got a bit of a facelift!
