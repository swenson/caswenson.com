Day Camp 4 Developers
=====================

I'll be talking at this week's [Day Camp 4 Developers](http://daycamp4developers.com/) on version control
(or source code control, or source code management, or whatever we want to call it this week).
It'll be an introductory talk introducing why you should use version control, how it works in general, and then going into some specific workflows with git, the notorious version control system.
I've had a lot of fun writing the talk, so it should be a lot of fun to hear it.

There are several other great talks that are going to happen:

* Lorna Jane Mitchell: Practical Software Estimation Techniques, or "How Late?"
* Thursday Bram: How to Make Good Documentation a Regular Part of Your Day
* Brendan Wovchko: How to Speak Business & Eradicate Confusion in Software Development
* Me: Source Code Management and Version Control

It's only $40 to sit on this great set of talks. Friday, July 26, 2013. 8am PST to 12:30am PST.
