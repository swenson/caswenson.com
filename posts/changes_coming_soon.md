Changes coming soon
===================
This is the first post of the year. That's a little sad, but I think I am going to be redoing this site a bit in the near future.

So, some upcoming changes:

* Errata for my book -- this link has been on the RHS of my page for quite a while now, and I haven't gotten around to compiling this errata.  I will do so in the next few days.

* Notes on upcoming projects. I am currently working on several projects, open source and not, and a few writing projects. Expect more details on these.

* ... and more.
