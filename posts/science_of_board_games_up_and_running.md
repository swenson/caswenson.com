“Science of Board Games” up and running
===========================================
I have launched a new blog, <a href="http://www.scienceofboardgames.com">Science of Board Games</a>.  Basically, musings on board games, particularly related to computer science, simulations, and mathematics.  I wrote a quick entry on Scrabble words, and I have another entry on dice coming up soon.

We'll see how it goes.
