Intel Threading Challenge 2010, ICFP 2010
=========================================
I'm a sucker for programming contests, and have been since high school.

I thought I would post here about one ongoing contest and one upcoming one.

First, the <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/contests/threading-challenge-prof-2010/codecontest.php">Intel Threading Challenge</a> has already started.  Essentially, it a little programming contest that is supposed to test your ability to program effectively for a large multi-threaded task.  The "Master" section this year is writing a program to compute a simple and laborious graph theoretic property.

Second, the annual <a href="http://icfpcontest.org/">ICFP programming contest</a> is right around the corner.  Although nominally a functional programming contest, anyone can enter in any language.  It's an super-fun, intense 72-hour competition.  If you want to try to place, I recommend having a group of about 2&ndash;4 strong programmers.  I won't be able to compete this year because of a scheduling conflict. :(
