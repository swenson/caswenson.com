Whatâ€™s the point?
===================
So, it might be a good time to talk about the goal of this blog.

As you can tell from the title, I like computer science.  I also like math, typesetting, writing, editing, and all sorts of other things.  I am currently writing a book as well as working full time, and a dozen other projects at a time.  This blog I intend to be a sort of place for me to discuss things on my mind regarding these topics, especially writing, science, math, etc.  I also intend to write little snippets and articles about topics important or interesting to me.

Please feel free to comment and let me know what you think about these things.  The topics I will publish are mostly for my own enjoyment, as I like to write, but I would be pleased if others found anything I said useful.

Cheers.
