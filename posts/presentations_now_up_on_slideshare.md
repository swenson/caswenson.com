Presentations now up on slideshare
==================================
Someone recently requested that I post some of my older presentations on miscellaneous topics.

When I was more actively involved with teaching and research at <a href="http://www.utulsa.edu/">The University of Tulsa</a>, I would often give presentations on random things.  Programming, research I was doing, my anal retentiveness, whatever.  We often had weekly meetings for most of my graduate program, so I would give talks there, or at ACM meetings.

I have been tracking some of these down and posting them to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/caswenson/slideshows">my slideshare account</a>, although I will maintain a list of them (as well as descriptions) <a href="http://www.caswenson.com/presentations">here on this site</a> (you can always see them on the slide bar.

As a sample, here is one that is based on some (abandoned) research I did on applying genetic programming to chess.
