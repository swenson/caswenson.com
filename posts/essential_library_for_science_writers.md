Essential Library for Science Writers
=====================================
As I have been writing my book, I thought to give a list of what books are most helpful to me while writing.  I try to limit the books to be general purpose, in that they can apply to non-science writers, and to non-book writing, when possible.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226104036?ie=UTF8&tag=mathfigu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0226104036">The Chicago Manual of Style</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mathfigu-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0226104036" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> &mdash; This is <em>the</em> book for style guidance in general.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201134470?ie=UTF8&tag=mathfigu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201134470">The TeXbook</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mathfigu-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0201134470" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Donald Knuth &mdash; I write in LaTeX, so it naturally helps, but it also presents a strong low-level view of typesetting a book that can be very informative.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0881792063?ie=UTF8&tag=mathfigu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0881792063">The Elements of Typographic Style</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mathfigu-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0881792063" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Robert Bringhurst &mdash; beautiful book about the beautiful topic of typography.  Very nice book on design, fonts, and many other aspects.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527330?ie=UTF8&tag=mathfigu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596527330">CSS: The Definitive Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mathfigu-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596527330" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Eric A. Meyer &mdash; If you are designing content for the web, this book is a must.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/088385063X?ie=UTF8&tag=mathfigu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=088385063X">Mathematical Writing</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mathfigu-20&l=as2&o=1&a=088385063X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Donald Knuth &mdash; A good overall book on writing science and mathematics.  It's getting harder to find, though, but most of the text is available <a href="http://tex.loria.fr/typographie/mathwriting.pdf">online for free</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/046500489X?ie=UTF8&tag=mathfigu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=046500489X">The Associated Press Stylebook on Briefing on Media Law</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mathfigu-20&l=as2&o=1&a=046500489X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> &mdash; If you are writing an article for many online and print media outlets, knowing the AP style manual is a must.  The alphabetical organization of this helps find topics fast, but doesn't make for very good topical reading (like <em>Chicago</em> does).

Although not a book, <a href="http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/">Grammar Girl</a> puts out a podcast that provides many useful tips for writers and editors, to help keep you on your grammatical toes.

Last, but not least, you can just pick up a book that you like and see how it states things.  Older books (say, 1960s and before) are often better, since a lot more care often went into their making, but a good solid book by a competent publisher today can also be good, in many cases.  Many publishing houses will also post their style manuals and guides on the web for authors to take a look at.
