Switch to Bluehost
==================
I recently switched over this blog, and soon the rest of my sites, to <a href="http://www.bluehost.com" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>.  They seem to support all of the features I need (RoR, PHP, shell access, multiple domains, decent bandwidth and storage) for a reasonable price.  It's not virtual dedicated, but it's not priced like virtual dedicated either.

So far, I am liking it quite a bit, though I have not played around with the Rails bits yet, though I will quite soon, as several of my current projects use it.
